rebels trust EAGLE library
===================

This is an [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) component library aimed at building DIY stompboxes. It contains my personal selections from and modifications to the [Gaussmarkov](http://gaussmarkov.net/wordpress/tools/software/eagle/eagle-2-libraries/) and [Madbean](http://www.madbeanpedals.com/forum/index.php?topic=12945.0) libraries.

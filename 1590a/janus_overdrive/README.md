JANUS

**OVERDRIVE + DISTORTION + BOOST**

Â© 2016 burr settles


### overview

JANUS is a versatile and open-ended dirt box. It is a mash-up of several classic 1970s distortion circuits, starting with the [Dan Armstrong Blue Clipper](http://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/danarmstrong/blueclipper) (1972) which was supposedly one of the first op-amp-based "smooth fuzz" effects. As legend has it, someone from MXR picked one of these up at a NAMM convention, which inspired the [MXR Distortion+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXR_Distortion_%2B) (1973), which in turn was adapted into both the [DOD 250 Overdrive/Preamp](http://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/dod/first/250) (1976) and the [MXR MicroAmp](http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m133-micro-amp) (a booster pedal, not a distortion).

Since these are all essentially the same circuit with a few different values, the same board will let you build pretty much any of them. JANUS uses a combination of values I came to like through experimentation, and adds a CLIP switch to toggle between different clipping diodes (or no diodes at all). This makes JANUS a multi-faced, multi-purpose vintage distortion box packed into in a small package.


### notes

* The clipping diodes (D1-D4) are your choice. Feel free to experiment. In my build, I used a pair of 1N914s for D2-D3 (symmetrical), and a 3mm red LED coupled with a NOS germanium for D4-D5 (asymmetrical).
* If you use an on/off/on SPDT for the CLIP switch, the "off" position adds a third "dirty boost" option. (The op-amp can be overdriven without the help of clipping diodes... although be prepared as it's a _lot_ louder!)
* Alternatively, if you don't want a CLIP switch, you can either:
  1. jumper pin 2 to pin 1 and use D4-D5 (larger, 4-spaced diodes like germanium or Schottky), or
  2. jumper pin 2 to pin 3 and use D2-D3 (smaller, 3-spaced diodes like 1N914, 1N4148, or LEDs).
* If you want to omit the DRIVE control (e.g., a Blue Clipper clone), jumper pin 2 to 3. This is fixed at maximum gain.
* If you want to build a dirty boost with one control (e.g., a MicroAmp clone), jumper pin 2 to 3 for the VOLUME pot, and use only the DRIVE control. (You may also want to add a 10k resistor from pin 1 to either 2 or 3 to be faithful to that circuit).


### bill of materials

I recommend building with the JANUS values, those are the only ones I have tested.

Since I edited the circuit to my own liking and squeezed it all into a 1590a-sized board, I omited some components for some of the source circuits, and you can't get a 100% faithful clone of all the circuits JANUS is based on. However, if you still prefer to try a straight-up clone of one of the source effects, you can try the alternate component values below:

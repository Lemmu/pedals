JANUS
=====

**OVERDRIVE + DISTORTION + BOOST**

Â© 2016 burr settles


### overview

JANUS is a versatile and open-ended dirt box. It is designed as a mash-up of the [Dan Armstrong Blue Clipper](http://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/danarmstrong/blueclipper) (1972), was supposedly one of the first op-amp-based "smooth" distortion effects. As legend has it this inspired the [MXR Distortion+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MXR_Distortion_%2B) (1973), which in turn was adapted into both the [DOD 250 Overdrive](http://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/dod/first/250) (1976) and the [MXR MicroAmp](http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m133-micro-amp) (a booster pedal).

Since these are all essentially the same circuit with a few different values, the same board will let you build pretty much any of them. JANUS takes my favorite combination of values from some experimentation, and adds a CLIP switch to toggle between different clipping diodes (or no diodes at all). This makes JANUS a multi-faced, multi-purpose little distortion box packed into in a small package.


### notes

* The clipping diodes (D1-D4) are your choice. In my build, I used a pair of 1N914s for D2-D3 (symmetrical), and a 3mm red LED with a NOS germanium diode for D4-D5 (asymmetrical).
* If you use an on/off/on SPDT for the CLIP switch, the "off" position adds a third "dirty boost" option. (The op-amp can be overdriven without the help of clipping diodes.)
* Alternatively, if you don't want a CLIP switch, you can:
..1. jumper to pin 1 and use D4-D5 (larger, 4-spaced diodes like germanium or Schottky), or
..2. jumper pin 2 to pin 3 and use D2-D3 (smaller, 3-spaced diodes like 1N914, 1N4148, or LEDs).
* If you want to omit the DRIVE control (e.g., a Blue Clipper clone), jumper pin 2 to 3. This will be fixed at maximum distortion.
* If you just want to build a dirty boost with one control (e.g., a MicroAmp clone), jumper pin 2 to 3 for the VOLUME pot, and just use the DRIVE control.


### bill of materials

I recommend building the JANUS values, but if you'd prefer to build a straight-up clone of one of the source pedals, here are the component values to experiment with:

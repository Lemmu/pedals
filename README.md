rebels trust pedals
===================

This repo contains work-in-progress circuit designs for guitar effect pedals.

**Backstory:** I write songs and play guitar for [delicious pastries](http://deliciouspastries.bandcamp.com/), and as our sound has become more effects-driven, I've grown an interest in the underlying technology of analog effects. This lead me to build several boutique pedals/clones from stompbox kits and PCBs designed by others. I'm now at a point that I want to experiment with my own circuit modifications, designs, and layouts. This is my playground for that.

Subfolders contain [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) schematic and two-sided circuit board files (e.g., for an [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) order), and maybe some documentation. I am not trying any one-sided layouts for etching. At this point, no designs are verified or even finalized. As time goes on, I will actually build these and documentation will be more complete! :)

They're all named after mythological characters.


medium pedals (1590b enclosure)
------------------------

These are mostly classic effects with personal mods for versatility that I'd like to see (but haven't found anyone else try yet).

- Chimera Chorus (based on the Zombie Chorus with vibe mod)
- Gemini Phaser (a switchable MXR Phase 45/90 mashup)


small pedals (1590a enclosure)
-----------------------

After building a [two-stage phaser](https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/transistor-clustering-for-diy-guitar-effects/) in a tiny enclosure like this, I fell in love with the sleek one-knob aesthetic and simplicity. So I decided to try designing a line of compact pedals restricted to a single knob control and/or 1-2 optional switches (if necessary).

- Cerberus Boost (three-frequency boost, based on the DA Red Ranger)
- Cyclops Fuzz (based on the EHX OpAmp Big Muff Pi)
- Echo Nymph Delay (a PT2399 analog delay)
- Gaius Ringer (octaver/ring-modulator, based on the DA Green Ringer)
- Janus Drive (a mashup of the MXR Dist+ and DOD 250 Overdrive)
- Siren Chorus (based on the Little Angel chorus)

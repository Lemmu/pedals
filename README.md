rebels trust pedals
===================

This repo contains work-in-progress circuit designs for DIY guitar effect pedals.

I write songs and play guitar for [delicious pastries](http://deliciouspastries.bandcamp.com/); as our sound has became more effects-driven, I became interested in the underlying technology of  analog effects. So I built a few boutique pedals/clones from stompbox kits and PCBs designed by others. I'm now at a point where I want to experiment with my own circuit modifications, designs, and layouts. This is a playground for that.

Subfolders contain [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) schematic and two-sided circuit board files (e.g., for an [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) order), and maybe some documentation. The `rebelstrust-lbr` directory contains the EAGLE library I'm using. I am not making any one-sided layouts, since I don't want to etch my own PCBs (for now). At this point, no designs are verified or even finalized. As time goes on, I will actually build and test these, and documentation will be more complete! :)

I'm naming the pedals after various mythological characters.


1590A Pedals (small enclosure)
-----------------------

After building a [two-stage phaser](https://slackprop.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/transistor-clustering-for-diy-guitar-effects/) in a tiny enclosure like this, I fell in love with the sleek one-knob aesthetic and simplicity. So I decided to try a line of compact pedals restricted to a single knob control (and maybe a toggle switch).

- Cerberus Boost (three-frequency boost, based on the DA Red Ranger)
- Cyclops Fuzz (based on the EHX Big Muff Pi v4)
- Gaius Ringer (octaver/ring-modulator, based on the DA Green Ringer)
- Janus Drive (a mashup of the MXR Dist+ and DOD 250 Overdrive w/ switchable diodes)
- Phrike Tremolo (based on the EA Tremolo)
- Siren Chorus (PT2399 chorus based on the MBP Glam)

1590B Pedals (medium enclosure)
------------------------

These are mostly classic effects with some versaility mods I'd like to have (but haven't seen anywhere else yet).

- Chimera Chorus (based on the Zombie Chorus with vibe mod)
- Gemini Phaser (a switchable MXR Phase 45/90 mashup)
